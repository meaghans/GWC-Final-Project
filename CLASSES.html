      <p>- Consult your teachers and high school counselor on what courses are most appropriate for you at your high school. </p>
      <p>- Take rigorous courses in your personal and intellectual interests as long as you are not sacrificing overall course rigor.</p>

<p><strong><i>Advice from Upper Classmen</i></strong></p>
<p>"Participate in school activities; Go to football games, go to athletic events, go to school concerts or plays, you won't regret it and there are only so many before high school is up," by Senior Kyle Alvarez</p>
<p>"Be nice to everybody. Even if you think they aren't a person you'd be friends with, you never know what you might have in common. Branch out and meet new people," by Senior Kate Kugler</p>
<p>"Be self-motivated and stay on top of work as much as you can because once you fall behind it's hard to climb back up and get caught up," by Senior Oliver Parker</p>
<p>"Life goes on. There will be times where you feel completely stressed out and like nothing is going your way. Stay positive and know things will always get  better," by Senior Annika Anderson</p>
